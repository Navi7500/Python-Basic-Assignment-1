        "2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Python, predefined keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes within the language's syntax. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers(like variable names, function names, or class names) because they are integral to Python's structure and functionality.\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of their role and some examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "Role of predefined Keywords:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Syntax Defination:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Keywords define the grammatical rules and structure of Python code. They dictate how statements are formed and interpreted.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Control Flow:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Many keywords control the flow of execution in a program, such as conditional branching (e.g., if, elif, else) and looping (e.g., For, While).\n",
        "\n",
        " * Data structures and Types:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  . Keywords such as try, except, finally, and raise facilitate error handling in programs.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Module Importing:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Keywords like import, and from are used to bring in external modules of code.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Logical operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Keywords such as and, or, and not are used to perform logical operations.\n",

        "\n",
        "Mutable Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition:\n",
        "\n",
        " . Mutable objects can be changed after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        " . Modifying a mutable object directly changes its value in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Lists (list)\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Dictionaries (dict)\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Sest (set)\n",
        "\n",
        " * Chracteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . They allow for in-place modifications, which can be useful for performance reasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "  . They can be more memory-intensive due to the ability to change them.\n",
        "\n",
        "  . When a mutable object is assigned to a new variable, both variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Example Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "    list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "Immutable Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Defination:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Immutable objects cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Examples:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Integers (int)\n",
        "  . Floats (float)\n",
        "  . Strings (str0\n",
        "  . Tuples (tuple)\n",
        "\n",
        " * Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . They provide data integrity because their values cannot be accidentally changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  . They are generally more memory-efficient when used as keys in dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "  . When you change the value of an immutable object, you are creating a new abject in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Example Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "    String1 = \"hello\"\n",
        "    String2 = String1\n",
        "    String1 = \"world\"\n",
        "    print(string2)\n",
        "#output : hello\n",
        "   #String[0] = \"J\"\n",

        "\n",
        "-> In Python, type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a variable's data type from one type to another. This is essential for performing operations that require specific data types or for ensuring data compatibility. Python offers both implicit and explicit type casting.\n",
        "Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "1. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Conversion):\n",
        " * Python automatically performs implicit type casting in certain situations, typically when converting to a \"higher\" data type to avoid data loss.\n",
        " * For example, when adding an integer to a float, Python automatically converts the integer to a float.\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "num_int = 123\n",
        "num_float = 1.23\n",
        "num_new = num_int + num_float\n",
        "print(\"datatype of num_int:\", type(num_int))\n",
        "print(\"datatype of num_float:\", type(num_float))\n",
        "print(\"Value of num_new:\", num_new)\n",
        "print(\"datatype of num_new:\", type(num_new))\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the integer num_int is implicitly converted to a float before the addition, resulting in a float num_new.\n",
        "2. Explicit Type Casting (Manual Conversion):\n",
        " * Explicit type casting occurs when you manually convert a data type using built-in functions.\n",
        " * Python provides functions like int(), float(), str(), and others for this purpose.\n",
        "Here are some common explicit type casting functions:\n",
        " * int(): Converts a value to an integer.\n",
        " * float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.\n",
        " * str(): Converts a value to a string.\n",
        "Here are some examples:\n",
        "# String to Integer:\n",
        "string_num = \"123\"\n",
        "integer_num = int(string_num)\n",
        "print(integer_num, type(integer_num))\n",
        "\n",
        "# Integer to Float:\n",
        "integer_num = 123\n",
        "float_num = float(integer_num)\n",
        "print(float_num, type(float_num))\n",
        "\n",
        "# Float to String:\n",
        "float_num = 123.45\n",
        "string_num = str(float_num)\n",
        "print(string_num, type(string_num))\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Considerations:\n",
        " * Not all conversions are possible. For example, converting a string like \"hello\" to an integer will result in an error.\n",
        " * Type casting can lead to data loss. For instance, converting a float to an integer will truncate the decimal part.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are true or false. The primary conditional statement in Python is the if statement, which can be extended with elif (else if) and else clauses.\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of how they work, along with illustrative examples:\n",
        "1. if Statement:\n",
        " * The if statement checks if a given condition is True.\n",
        " * If the condition is True, the code block within the if statement is executed.\n",
        " * If the condition is False, the code block is skipped.\n",
        "x = 10\n",
        "if x > 5:\n",
        "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the condition x > 5 is True, so the message \"x is greater than 5\" is printed.\n",
        "2. if...else Statement:\n",
        " * The if...else statement provides an alternative code block to execute when the if condition is False.\n",
        " * If the if condition is True, the if block is executed.\n",
        " * If the if condition is False, the else block is executed.\n",
        "y = 3\n",
        "if y > 5:\n",
        "    print(\"y is greater than 5\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"y is not greater than 5\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, y > 5 is False, so the message \"y is not greater than 5\" is printed.\n",
        "3. if...elif...else Statement:\n",
        " * The if...elif...else statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.\n",
        " * elif (short for \"else if\") clauses are used to check additional conditions if the previous if or elif conditions are False.\n",
        " * The else clause is executed if none of the preceding conditions are True.\n",
        "score = 75\n",
        "\n",
        "if score >= 90:\n",
        "    print(\"A\")\n",
        "elif score >= 80:\n",
        "    print(\"B\")\n",
        "elif score >= 70:\n",
        "    print(\"C\")\n",
        "elif score >= 60:\n",
        "    print(\"D\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"F\")\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, score is 75. The conditions are checked in order:\n",
        " * score >= 90 is False.\n",
        " * score >= 80 is False.\n",
        " * score >= 70 is True.\n",
        " * Thus, \"C\" is printed, and the rest of the conditions are skipped.\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        " * Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks. The code within an if, elif, or else block must be indented.\n",
        " * Conditions: Conditions are expressions that evaluate to True or False. They can involve comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=), logical operators (and, or, not), and other boolean expressions.\n",
        " * Order: The order of elif clauses matters. The first elif condition that evaluates to True will be executed.\n",
        " * Optional else: The else clause is optional. You can have an if statement with only elif clauses, or just an if statement.\n",
        " * Boolean context: Python allows many objects to be tested for truth value. For example, empty lists, empty strings, and the number 0 are false in a boolean context. Non empty lists, non empty strings, and non zero numbers are true in a boolean context.\n",
        "my_list = []\n",
        "if my_list:\n",
        "    print(\"list is not empty\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"list is empty\")\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Certainly! Python offers several types of loops, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "1. for Loop:\n",
        " * Description: The for loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects.\n",
        " * Use Cases:\n",
        "   * Iterating through collections of data.\n",
        "   * Performing an action a specific number of times.\n",
        "   * Processing elements in a sequence.\n",
        " * Examples:\n",
        "   * Iterating through a list:\n",
        "   fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "for fruit in fruits:\n",
        "    print(fruit)\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Iterating through a range:\n",
        "   for i in range(5):\n",
        "    print(i) #prints 0,1,2,3,4\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Iterating through a string:\n",
        "   text = \"Python\"\n",
        "for char in text:\n",
        "    print(char)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. while Loop:\n",
        " * Description: The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
        " * Use Cases:\n",
        "   * Repeating an action until a certain condition is met.\n",
        "   * Handling situations where the number of iterations is unknown beforehand.\n",
        "   * Creating loops that depend on user input or external events.\n",
        " * Examples:\n",
        "   * Counting until a condition is met:\n",
        "   count = 0\n",
        "while count < 5:\n",
        "    print(count)\n",
        "    count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Looping until user input:\n",
        "   response = \"\"\n",
        "while response.lower() != \"quit\":\n",
        "    response = input(\"Enter 'quit' to exit: \")\n",
        "    print(\"You entered:\", response)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Nested Loops:\n",
        " * Description: A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. This allows you to iterate through multiple levels of data.\n",
        " * Use Cases:\n",
        "   * Processing two-dimensional arrays (matrices).\n",
        "   * Generating combinations or permutations.\n",
        "   * Creating patterns or grids.\n",
        " * Examples:\n",
        "   * Iterating through a 2D list:\n",
        "   matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
        "for row in matrix:\n",
        "    for element in row:\n",
        "        print(element)\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Generating coordinate pairs:\n",
        "   for x in range(3):\n",
        "    for y in range(3):\n",
        "        print(f\"({x}, {y})\")\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Loop Control Statements:\n",
        " * break: Terminates the loop prematurely.\n",
        "   * Example:\n",
        "   for i in range(10):\n",
        "    if i == 5:\n",
        "        break\n",
        "    print(i) #prints 0,1,2,3,4\n",
        "\n",
        " * continue: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.\n",
        "   * Example:\n",
        "   for i in range(10):\n",
        "    if i % 2 == 0:\n",
        "        continue\n",
        "    print(i) #prints 1,3,5,7,9\n",
        "\n",
        " * pass: Acts as a placeholder when a loop is syntactically required but no action is needed.\n",
        "   * Example:\n",
        "   for i in range(5):\n",
        "    if i == 2:\n",
        "        pass #do nothing here\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        print(i)\n",
        "\n",
        "These loop constructs and control statements provide Python with flexible tools for handling repetitive tasks and iterating through Data.\n",
